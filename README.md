## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography



I have used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat&category=Sans+Serif) for the body text on the site. Monserrat is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

## Features

The website is comprised of X pages which are extended from a base template.

* Home page
* Login page
* Register page
* Profile page
* Error page

### Elements found on each page

* Favicon 

  ![Titbit favicon](documentation/favicon.png)

* Navbar - The Navbar is displayed on all pages of the website and allows users to navigate the site with ease. The navbar is comprised of a logo, the sites name, links to navigate the site and a search bar. The links on the navbar will vary depending on whether a user is logged into their account.

### Future Implementations 🧠

In future implementations I would like to:

* Add change and reset password functionality to the profile section.
* Give users the option to delete their account in the profile section.
* Allow admin to be able to delete posts that contain offensive material.
* Prepopulate the login fields after a user registers on the site and is redirected to the login page - this is good UX as we shouldn't expect a user to fill in the form with information we already have. 

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### Error Handling 

While researching the best way to handle errors in a Flask application using blueprints I came across the following [article](https://nrodrig1.medium.com/flask-blueprints-error-handling-and-config-file-example-d1a031070763). I really liked how this solution allowed me to create a blueprint to custom handle a number of different errors, rather than just creating a single 404 error page.

### Deployment

### Local Development

#### How to Fork

To fork the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [Titbit](https://github.com/luandretta/titbit).

3. Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

#### How to Clone

To clone the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [Titbit](https://github.com/luandretta/titbit).

3. Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.

4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.

5. Type the following command in the terminal (after the git clone you will need to paste the link you copied in step 3 above):

    ```bash
