## Design

### Colour Scheme



![Colour Scheme for Titbit](documentation/###.png)

### Typography



I have used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat&category=Sans+Serif) for the body text on the site. Monserrat is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

## Features

The website is comprised of X pages which are extended from a base template.

* Home page
* Login page
* Register page
* Profile page
* Error page

### Elements found on each page

* Favicon 

  ![Titbit favicon](documentation/favicon.png)

* Navbar - The Navbar is displayed on all pages of the website and allows users to navigate the site with ease. The navbar is comprised of a logo, the sites name, links to navigate the site and a search bar. The links on the navbar will vary depending on whether a user is logged into their account.

  __User logged in Navbar__

### Future Implementations 🧠

In future implementations I would like to:

* Add change and reset password functionality to the profile section.
* Give users the option to delete their account in the profile section.
* Allow admin to be able to delete posts that contain offensive material.
* Prepopulate the login fields after a user registers on the site and is redirected to the login page - this is good UX as we shouldn't expect a user to fill in the form with information we already have. 

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### Error Handling 

While researching the best way to handle errors in a Flask application using blueprints I came across the following [article](https://nrodrig1.medium.com/flask-blueprints-error-handling-and-config-file-example-d1a031070763). I really liked how this solution allowed me to create a blueprint to custom handle a number of different errors, rather than just creating a single 404 error page.
